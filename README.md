# EDA with Python


### Outline

- Project Overview
- Dataset Used
- Libraries Used


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates essential EDA techniques using Python libraries such as `xxxx`. The dataset is processed through several preprocessing steps, including:

- xxxxxxx

These steps prepare xxxxxx.

You can view the full process in the Jupyter Notebook [here](xxxxx). 


## Dataset Used
The dataset used in this project is originally sourced from Kaggle and cleaned using Python. You can access it [here](https://github.com/Lillian1070/showcase_python_dataCleaning_1).

## Libraries Used
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, including plotting graphs like histograms, scatter plots, etc.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization and enhanced graphical representations
- **SciPy**: For scientific and technical computing, including statistical tests and optimizations (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test)
