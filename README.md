## Project Overview
This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques using Python. The main focus is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in the dataset. The EDA involves:

- Visualizing the data (covering univariate / bivariate analysis & categorical data distribution)
- Feature engineering (if needed)
- Identifying patterns or trends
- Investigating feature importance
- Checking assumptions
  
You can view the full process in the Jupyter Notebook in this repo [here](xxxxx). 


## Dataset Used
The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihb/coffee-quality-data-cqi) and has been cleaned using Python in a separate [data cleaning project](https://github.com/Lillian1070/showcase_python_dataCleaning_1). The cleaned dataset includes 206 coffee samples from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), and it is characterized by features such as country of origin, company, altitude, harvest year, processing method, sensory attributes, moisture percentage, defects, color, expiration, certification body, and more. You can access the cleaned dataset [here](https://github.com/Lillian1070/showcase_python_dataCleaning_1/blob/main/cleaned_dataset.csv).


## Key Findings
Throughout the exploratory analysis, the following key insights were uncovered:

- [Insight 1]: [Brief description of insight and its significance]
- [Insight 2]: [Brief description of insight and its significance]
- [Insight 3]: [Brief description of insight and its significance]

These findings provide a clearer picture of the dataset and its relationships, paving the way for more advanced analysis or predictive modeling.


## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For handling and manipulating the dataset, such as summarizing data, filtering, and grouping
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations like handling arrays and computing statistical measures
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, including plotting graphs like histograms, scatter plots, etc.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization and enhanced graphical representations. Used for heatmaps, pair plots, and correlation matrices to reveal deeper patterns in the data
